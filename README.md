# Piano Project - Codecademy Bootcamp

## Overview
The Piano Project is a web application developed during my Codecademy Bootcamp. The project showcases the interactive features of JavaScript to add dynamic behavior to a piano-themed webpage that plays the "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" song. Users can play piano keys, change key colors, and progress through a lyrics display using event handlers and functions.

## Project Structure

### 1. HTML and CSS
The project utilizes HTML and CSS to structure and style the piano keys, lyrics display, and progression buttons.

### 2. JavaScript
The main.js file focuses on handling the piano key interactions. It uses a combination of event handlers and functions to change key colors when clicked and revert to the original state when released. It also incorporates a lyrics progression feature. Users can advance through the lyrics by clicking on the progress button.

## Piano Interaction
Users can click on piano keys, triggering a change in key color.
Key colors are randomly generated when pressed and return to their original state when released.

## Lyrics Progression
Users progress through the lyrics display by clicking on a designated button.
The program dynamically updates the displayed lyrics and associated piano notes.

## Running the Program
- Download the project files through your local terminal by running the command below: 
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Olakunleniola/Piano-Project.git
    ```

+ Open the HTML file in a web browser to experience the piano interaction and lyrics progression.
